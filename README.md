# Online TOML to JSON converter

A simple tool for converting [TOML][toml] to JSON.

> **TOML** (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language) aims to be a minimal configuration file format that's easy to read due to obvious semantics. TOML is designed to map unambiguously to a hash table. TOML should be easy to parse into data structures in a wide variety of languages.
